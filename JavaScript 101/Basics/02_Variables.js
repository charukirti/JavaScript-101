// ** JavaScript Variable

// ! JavaScript Variable is a named storage or container which holds the value

/* Variable in JavaScript is created by using var, let and const keyword */

// ** Ex :- let variable;

// In this we can assign value to variable using '=' "Assignment Operator"

// ** Ex :- let variable = "Var";

// Also we can declare multiple variables at one time/line

// ** Ex :- let name = "Charukirti", age = "19", ph = 937051**07;

/* For better readability it's not recommended. Insted of this we should use 
multiline varient

let name = "Charukirti";
let age = "19";
let ph = 937051**07;

*/

// ** We can change the value of variable as many times as we want

// let userName = "Charukirti";
// console.log(userName);

/* changed value */

// userName = "Aniket";
// console.log(userName);

// Variable Naming

/* Rules : 

The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.

The first character must not be a digit.

*/

// "use strict";
// let num = 12;

// console.log(num);

// !. To use unchangable variable use const keyword.

/* we can't change value of a variable with const keyword. */

// ** Ex : const PI = 12.5;
